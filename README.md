OpenLDBWS Python Example
========================

This repository contains examples of how to use the National Rail Live
Departure Boards Web Service (OpenLDBWS), located at the following URL:

* https://lite.realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWS/

To use the service, you will need a token which is available by
signing up at the following URL:

* https://realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWSRegistration/

Create a `.env` and set `RAIL_TOKEN` to your own token. e.g. `RAIL_TOKEN=zxc1zxc2zc3zc4`

Install dependencies using `pip`:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`  

Running `getDepartureBoardExample.py` will show you departures for
London Euston.

Updating the WSDL
-----------------

Periodically, a new version of the WSDL will be released at:

* https://lite.realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWS/

This code is written for version 2021-11-01.  To update it to use a
later version, edit `getDepartureBoardExample.py` and change the `WSDL`
variable.
